# AgentPay Instructions

Use AgentPay MCP tools when the human wants to create a Celo wallet, check balance, send stablecoins, pay invoices, purchase x402 services, prepare batch payouts, handle remittance routes, pay another agent, execute after owner Review & Sign, or track status.

If the human asks you to make a crypto payment and AgentPay tools are not available, install AgentPay yourself only if you have terminal access and explicit approval to modify local runtime configuration:

```bash
npx @agentpay-ai/agentpay-celo install
```

The default install connects to the authenticated consumer AgentPay MCP at `https://wallet.agentpay.site/celo/mcp`, so humans do not need Supabase, RPC, executor, deployer, or bytecode config. The separate paid public execution ASP is `https://mcp.agentpay.site/celo/mcp` and is used only after Review & Sign. Ask them to reload or reconnect the runtime if needed, then return to the agent chat. Use `npx @agentpay-ai/agentpay-celo doctor` only for self-hosted/operator diagnostics. Use `npx @agentpay-ai/agentpay-celo setup-web` only for self-hosted/operator fallback when the setup/signing page cannot be served through the hosted agent flow.

Use AgentPay MCP tools only. Never bypass AgentPay with raw RPC calls, manual wallet transfers, raw LI.FI calls, shell scripts, or private-key handling.

AgentPay payment and balance tools support Celo mainnet and Celo Sepolia. Self-service chat wallet creation is currently available on Celo Sepolia; mainnet uses an operator-managed, readiness-gated account path. If the human does not clearly name one, ask whether they want mainnet or testnet before wallet, balance, route-target, admin, contract-call, quote, or payment preparation tools. Pass the selected value as `network: "mainnet" | "testnet"` whenever available. Users can switch networks per request; do not treat wallet, balance, allowlist, or payment state from one network as valid on the other.

Cross-chain routes are payment-time choices, not wallet-creation choices. Create a Celo Sepolia wallet through chat, or use an already activated operator-managed Celo mainnet account, then decide during quote or payment preparation whether the payment stays on Celo or uses a remittance route.

Balance workflow: when the user asks to check AgentPay balance, confirm mainnet or testnet if missing, call `get_agent_wallet`, then call `get_balance` with the same network. Report the AgentPay smart account address, network, USDC, USDT, USDm, and native CELO balances. Never use raw wallet balances, exchange balances, or generic RPC balance as AgentPay balance.

Payment workflow: call `quote_payment_route` when previewing direct paths, cross-chain routes, source token, fee, native fee, ETA, or max spend is useful. Then call `prepare_payment`, show all returned details, open the returned `reviewUrl`, and ask the owner to use Review & Sign for the EIP-712 signature. Poll `get_payment_signature`, then hand the signed `paymentIntentId` and signature to the public paid ASP's `execute_payment`; the consumer surface never executes directly. Then call `track_payment` plus `list_payment_events` for status or audit detail. The exact approval phrase is migration-only.

After installation, continue in chat: create the human's AgentPay wallet with `prepare_wallet_creation`, provide the setup signing link, use `check_wallet_creation`, help the human fund the wallet, parse invoices with `parse_invoice_payment`, preserve the returned `paymentType` when preparing parsed payments, search Bazaar with `search_x402_services` when the human wants a paid x402/API service but does not provide a URL, prepare the selected Bazaar service with `prepare_x402_service_request`, parse x402 v2 `PAYMENT-REQUIRED` responses with `parse_x402_payment_required`, preserve `paymentType: "X402_PAYMENT"`, run the Review & Sign owner-signature flow, call `retry_x402_request` after `track_payment` returns `COMPLETED`, read V2 `PAYMENT-RESPONSE`, include `payment-identifier` idempotency data when advertised, and explain that AgentPay receipt proof works when the merchant supports this proof bridge, prepare owner controls with `prepare_account_admin_transaction`, prepare payments, show max source spend, minimum output, exact native value, and max native fee before Review & Sign, use `prepare_contract_call` only to prepare a same-chain contract-call review and treat its execution as local/migration-only until a dedicated V2 typed authorization exists, explain the required top-up instead of asking for Review & Sign when AgentPay reports insufficient balance during quote or preparation, call `check_route_target_allowance` for LI.FI targets, call `prepare_route_target_allowance` when the owner needs an allowlist transaction, show target details and calldata hashes when present, call `track_payment` after execution before reporting completion, use `list_payment_events` for audit history, and never execute without a valid owner EIP-712 signature.

Pass the exact x402 request into both parse and retry. Its URL, method, body, and safe headers are bound into the owner-signed purpose; omission is allowed only for the GET-without-body fallback.

Reject vague confirmations like `yes`, `ok`, `go`, or `send it`; chat-only messages are not payment authorization. If balance is insufficient, do not ask for approval or Review & Sign; explain the required top-up.

The setup signature proves ownership only; the setup signature is not payment approval.

If you do not have terminal access, explain that AgentPay cannot be installed from this session.
